## My process

I first started out the project by using npx-create-next-app. I created a folder for my components, assets and styles. I installed sass as well.
I built out the product page first, then the image switching functionality. I built the product counter next, and also implemented the cart functionality. I finished up with making the page responsive, and adding mobile navigation.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

I learned how to display different content with the same component by passing props.

### Continued development

I'd be looking to learn more about state management with Context API and useReducer.
